## About
I have written server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 
I serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

## How to run
Clone this repository directory and run the script **entertainment_center.py**. You can view the page by opening **fresh_tomatoes.html**.
