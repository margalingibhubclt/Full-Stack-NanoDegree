# Project 3 - Multi User Blog

## About

In this project I have built a multi user blog (along the lines of Medium) where users can sign in and post blog posts as well as 'Like' and 'Comment' on other posts made on the blog. I have been hosting this blog on Google App Engine and I have been also be creating an authentication system for users to be able to register and sign in and then create blog posts.
